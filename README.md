# MazeSolver
Created the Square, Maze, MazeSolver, MyStack, and MazeSolverStack classes
Received input from text files that generated a maze object with walls, empty space, start,
and exit using a 2d array of Squares objects, employed inheritance to create a maze solver, 
parsed through a stack and saved empty neighboring Squares until the exit was reached, 
or the maze was deemed unsolvable.
